# ElectroHub

This project is currently in development.

It's meant to showcase my process of expanding my Vue skill set and to serve as a demo project.

I’m using both the Options API and Composition API styles—sometimes even using different approaches for the same logic. The goal is to demonstrate my understanding of the technology, rather than strictly following industry conventions.
