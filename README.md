# ElectroHub



First of all, thank you very much for taking the time to check out my project. This is a **resources management system for a company providing EV charging services**. It is a **personal project I built to expand my frontend skills with Vue 3**.

This project is built with a modern **technology stack**, featuring **TypeScript**, **Vue 3**, and **Mock.js** as the core foundation. To enhance functionality and user experience, it leverages a range of additional dependencies including **Element Plus** for UI components, **ECharts** for data visualisation, **FileSaver** and **XLSX** for file export capabilities, **Axios** for HTTP requests, **Less** for styling, and **Pinia** with **Vue Router** for state and routing management. The system also integrates with external services such as **Google Maps** for geolocation features and **TinyMCE** for rich text editing.

**Technology Stack**

1. **Core Technologies**: TypeScript, Vue 3, Mock.js
2. **Additional Dependencies**: Element Plus, ECharts, FileSaver, Axios, Less, Pinia, Vue Router, XLSX
3. **Integrated APIs**: Google Maps, TinyMCE



**Key Features**

- **Role-based Access Control**: Dynamic role assignment with both page-level and button-level permission control, implemented through custom directives and recursive menu handling.
- **Data Visualisation**: Integrated **ECharts** with a custom composable `useCharts` to render various charts for business insights.
- **Navigation & State Management**: Built a custom tab navigation component linked with **Pinia** and Vue Router, supporting recursive dynamic menu rendering and tab synchronisation.
- **Table & Pagination Utilities**: Developed reusable composables `useTable` and `usePagination` for efficient data display, including dynamic forms, validation, and fuzzy search with tree-select dropdowns.
- **Performance Optimisation**: Implemented **KeepAlive** with route meta and listeners for targeted caching and smoother navigation.
- **File Export**: Enabled one-click export of table data to **Excel** and TinyMCE content to **HTML**, using utilities like **FileSaver** and **XLSX**.
- **Enhanced UI Components**: Extended Element Plus with custom step forms and number-formatting plugins (thousand separators).
- **API & Network Layer**: Encapsulated **Axios** with interceptors and unified API endpoint management.
- **Interactive Map**: Integrated **Google Map API** for rendering maps, adding markers, and displaying information windows.
- **Content Management**: Used **TinyMCE** rich text editor for article publishing.
